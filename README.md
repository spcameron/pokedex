# PokeDex

This is the fifth guided project on Boot.dev. The goal is to build a Pokedex in a command-line REPL, using the PokeAPI to fetch all of the necessary data using GET requests.

The learning goals for this project are:
- Learn how to parse JSON in Go
- Practice making HTTP reqeusts in Go
- Learn how to build a CLI tool that makes interacting with a back-end server easier
- Get hands-on practice with local Go development and tooling
- Learn about caching and how to use it to improve performance

Overall, I thought this was a fun and simple project. I have really enjoyed learning Go over the last few days, and this gave me an opportunity to put a lot of the recent lessons to use. I don't think I'll extend the project at all, mostly because I just spent several weeks building a CLI app for my first portfolio project. However, I am motivated to find other ways to build upon the skills I learned through this project and the previous two courses using Go.
